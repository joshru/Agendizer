Main Features:
	• Ability to register a new user and have that information stored on the cssgate server.

	• Ability to log in to the application through the GUI and backend database validation.

	• Ability to create agendas that help abstract tasks by context (i.e. work, school, home, etc.)

	• Ability to create new tasks within each agenda and have them stored on the cssgate server.

	• Ability to delete tasks from the GUI and database.

	• Ability to mark tasks as completed and have that change reflected within the GUI and server database.

How to run our program (Java 8 required!):
	-> Simply run the included .jar file to get things going. From here you can create a new user or log in with an existing one. 
	-> After logging in you can create new agendas, create tasks within those agendas and get on to managing your life like a superstar!
	
	**NOTE: You might have to add the sql connector jar to the project yourself. The way IntelliJ structures its libraries might cause it to be different in the ide of your choice
